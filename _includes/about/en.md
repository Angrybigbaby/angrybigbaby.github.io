Hello, I'm Bigbaby Xiao, a tech enthusiast and a data development engineer with many years of experience. I've worked in several medium and large companies, and I'm currently doing data development at a central manufacturing enterprise. Besides data development, I also pay attention to cloud-native and backend technologies, and recently I've become quite interested in neural networks. From being a junior when I first started, to gradually becoming intermediate, senior, and then a technical lead for the team, I've gained some insights and feelings along the way, and I'm here to chat with you all.

I believe that the process of learning technology is like practicing kung fu in a martial arts novel, from being completely ignorant, to gradually learning the basics, then starting to understand in depth, and finally understanding the design philosophy and generating your own ideas. Not everyone has the time and energy to read the source code, so everyone will have a unique understanding of each technology. Of course, it is undeniable that subjective cognition inevitably has the possibility of being wrong. Therefore, for me personally, I especially welcome technical discussions. Sometimes, when two knowledgeable people chat, they can clarify the technology through discussion.

So here I am offering a humble opinion to elicit valuable ideas; please feel free to give me your advice.
