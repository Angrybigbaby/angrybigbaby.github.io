Hello, I’m Angry Bigbaby, a tech enthusiast and a data development engineer with years of experience. I’ve worked at several medium and large companies, and currently, I’m working as a data development engineer at a large manufacturing company. From starting as a junior developer to gradually becoming a mid-level and senior engineer, and eventually taking on the role of a technical lead responsible for guiding the team, I’ve gained some insights and reflections that I’d like to share here.

I believe that learning technology is like practicing martial arts in wuxia novels—starting from knowing nothing, gradually learning the basics, then diving deeper, and eventually understanding the design philosophy and coming up with your own ideas. Not everyone has the time and energy to read the source code, so each person will have their own unique understanding of each technology. Of course, it’s undeniable that there’s always a possibility of subjective misjudgment. For me personally, I especially enjoy technical exchanges. Sometimes, when two tech-savvy people chat, they can clarify technical concepts through back-and-forth discussion.

So here, I’m throwing out some ideas and would appreciate any guidance or feedback.
